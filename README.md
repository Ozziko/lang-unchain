## About the project
**langchain** ü¶úÔ∏èüîó tries to fit any LLM task / model / tool / API in a few lines of code that hide 
**a rabbit-hole of endless abstractions, chains and components.** This makes langchain code 
**unstable, practically impossible to read & understand, customize, verify, debug.**

**lang-unchain ü¶ã is the opposite:** a curated collection of self-contained jupyter notebooks, 
each explaining & solving a concrete LLM task in simple & readable python code, 
minimal abstractions, stable dependencies - so you can **easily read & understand, customize, verify, debug.**

## Notebooks
**Each jupyter/colab notebook is self-contained**, including everything needed to understand the LLM task it solves, 
run it and get the printed results: task overview, sources & references, installations & imports, 
downloading & processing sample data as needed, solving & explaining, analyzing results...

* `work in progress` **Chat with OpenAI gpt API in a few lines of code by Oz Livneh:** 
explaining & implementing all the basic functionality of langchain ChatOpenAI in less than 100 lines of simple code,
including token & budget calculation, retrying, async operations, **even OpenAI API features that langchain didn't
implement like getting the finish reason.**
* `work in progress` **Embed your docs for semantic search / clustering / RAG by Oz Livneh:** 
explaining about embedding and different models, demonstrating how to embed your docs for semantic search - 
first with OpenAI embedding API, then **with free & open-source local models**.
* `work in progress` **LLM Question answering on your docs by Oz Livneh:** explaining & implementing all the stages
needed to use an LLM like OpenAI gpt API for question answering on your docs.
* `unassigned` Text generation with a recent open-source LLM in colab
* `unassigned` Code generation with a recent open-source LLM in colab
* `unassigned` Fine-tuning a recent open-source LLM in colab
* `unassigned` Fine-tuning with RL on a recent open-source LLM in colab

## Discussion & contribution
* Any contribution is welcome!
* You're welcome to open an issue for requests, discussing notebooks, bugs, issues etc.
* **If you wish to contribute a notebook** - please message me ([email](oz.livneh@gmail.com) / 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oz-livneh/)) so we can discuss, add you to contributors (üëá) and list 
the notebook with `work in progress` until it's ready - so people can make suggestions, offer help etc.
